# ChatBot
ChatBot for Personal Project


Project Description:


The objective of this programming project is integrate APIs into our previous chatbot code. APIs are Application Programming Interfaces which acts as an intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. The projects original aim is to create a dynamic conversational agent that is able to interact and respond to a userâ€™s input. Within the chosen setup, the agent will imitate an old friend and enable the user to participate in conversations centering around topics such as favourite food, hobbies, and books. To further the abilities of the bot, APIs are used. For this project, I am implementing Google Translate API and Twitter API. The Google Translate API will allow my chatbot application to connect with google translate. This allows the bots output to be translated into other languages as well as allow the user to input text in different languages which will be translated into English for the bot. 


API Overview

The chosen APIs to be implemented with the bot are:
1.	Google translate API: With the google translate API, the chatbot will be able to connect with the google translate program and use its ability to translate text. This will allow the bot to output text in languages other than English. Additionally, the bot will also be able to translate user inputs from different languages into English and work off that input. As the chatbot is designed to be a friend, the feature will be very useful in allow the bot to chat and be a friend to people from different parts of the world
2.	Wikipedia API: The Wikipedia API connects the bot to the wiki and allows the bot to pull data from it. This provides the bot with knowledge on a variety of subjects and so increases the number of topics the bot can talk about. By combining the definitions pulled from Wikipedia with the other features the bot already possesses, it will be able to give more fleshed out and in-depth responses.
